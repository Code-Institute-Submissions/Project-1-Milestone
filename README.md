# Worlds-Bookstore-and-Cafe

Worlds is a fictional bookstore founded by a Maya Kirk, a self-proclaimed book worm
who decided to open a bookstore on the outskirts of Corkâ€™s busy city center.
She decided to create a quite little place where customers could come browse the shelves and then sit down with a warm beverage and enjoy there purchases. 

You can visit the deployed site [here](https://daniellaminyo.github.io/Project-1-Milestone/).


## 1. UX

### 1.1. Project Goals
This website was made for the bookstore to attract more customers and let existing customers know of discounts as they occur.
This site was also made for existing and potential customers who want to learn more about the bookstore,
it's location and contact information.

### 1.2. User stories
- As a user of the site, I'd like to easily find the information I am looking for.

- As a customer, I'd like to easily sign up for the bookstore's newsletter.


### 1.3. Wireframes
The wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I originally did not intend to make a gallery page so I didn't make any wireframes for it.

## 4. Testing

### Code Validators

#### [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

<img src="snapshots/error-message-1.png" alt="error message">
This error occured for every HTML page.

It was solved by renaming the two seperate label's for attribute to the id used in the input tag below that particular label.

**Home page + About page + Gallery page**
<img src="snapshots/HTML-no-errors.png" alt="no errors">

No further warnings or errors occured besides the one above.

**Contact page**
<img src="snapshots/contact-html.png" alt="error">

I solved the errors by removing the frameborder attribute and put the height into the style tag.

No further warnings or errors occured.

#### [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

<img src="snapshots/css-validation.png" alt="no-error">
<img src="css-warning.png" alt="warning">

No errors occured, a warning popped up but I decided to ignore it as --maincolor was a design decision.
